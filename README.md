# Optical-Character-Recogntion
This repository is a taste of Optical Character Recognition.

Firstly this isn't perfect and does show errors for the examples that I have put forward. My current aim with this repository is to be able to get an almost perfect Optical Character Recognition for NBA 2K19 Locker Codes.

This needs to be tested more because it was getting caught out on some letters. The next test will see how it does with black text on a white background due to the current example that I used was not very clear which was white text on a light blue background.

This technology can be very useful because if accurate enough it can potentially recognise old transcripts.
