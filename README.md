# Optical-Character-Recogntion
This repository is a taste of Optical Character Recognition.

Firstly this isn't perfect and does show errors for the examples that I have put forward. My current aim with this repository is to be able to get an almost perfect Optical Character Recognition for NBA 2K19 Locker Codes.
